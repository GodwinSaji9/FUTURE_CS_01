# Web Application Vulnerability Assessment using OWASP Juice Shop

# Overview
This project is part of my cybersecurity internship and focuses on web application vulnerability assessment using OWASP Juice Shop, a deliberately vulnerable web application designed for security training.
The objective of this task was to simulate the role of a security analyst by identifying, analyzing, and documenting common web application vulnerabilities based on the OWASP Top 10.

# Objectives
•	Understand common web application security vulnerabilities
•	Perform hands-on vulnerability testing in a safe environment
•	Identify and validate security flaws
•	Assess risk severity and potential impact
•	Suggest remediation measures for identified vulnerabilities

# Application Under Test
•	Application: OWASP Juice Shop
•	Type: Intentionally vulnerable web application
•	Purpose: Security training and awareness
•	Vulnerability Reference: OWASP Top 10

# Tools & Technologies Used
•	OWASP Juice Shop
•	Web Browser (Chrome/Firefox)
•	Browser Developer Tools
•	Manual security testing techniques
•	OWASP Top 10 vulnerability framework

# Vulnerabilities Identified
During the assessment, the following types of vulnerabilities were identified and analyzed:
•	SQL Injection (SQLi)
•	Broken Authentication
•	Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
•	Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
•	Security Misconfigurations
Each vulnerability was tested in a controlled manner and documented with evidence.

# Vulnerability Assessment Approach
1.	Application reconnaissance and feature exploration
2.	Identification of input points and authentication flows
3.	Manual testing for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
4.	Validation of vulnerabilities through exploitation
5.	Risk classification (High/Medium/Low)
6.	Documentation of findings and remediation suggestions

# Key Learnings
•	Practical understanding of real-world web vulnerabilities
•	Hands-on experience with OWASP Top 10 risks
•	How attackers exploit weak input validation and authentication
•	Importance of secure coding practices
•	How to document and communicate security findings clearly

# Disclaimer
This project was conducted strictly for educational purposes using an intentionally vulnerable application.
No real-world systems were targeted or harmed.

# Conclusion
This task provided valuable hands-on exposure to web application security testing and strengthened my foundational understanding of vulnerability assessment, risk analysis, and secure application design.
